Tired of needing to come up with synonyms for 'Therefore,' in your mathematical writing? Ponder no longer! This LaTeX package provides a macro to carefully select one of a multitude of choices. 

This project was inspired by [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gov71/mathematical_writing_synonyms_for_therefore/),  particularly

Using the package is easy. Download the file [therefore.sty](https://raw.github.com/bgschiller/latex-therefore/master/therefore.sty). In the preamble of your LaTeX document, enter

```latex
\usepackage{therefore}
```

Wherever you would otherwise laboriously choose a synonym for 'Therefore', simply type

```latex
\Therefore there are an infinite number of primes.
```
