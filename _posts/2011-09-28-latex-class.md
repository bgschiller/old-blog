[LaTeX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) is a markup language that is particularly useful for typesetting mathematics. Several teachers at WWU recommended or required that assignments be written in LaTeX. I learned it my Sophomore year and made a lot of mistakes on the way, so I decided to put together a class to help other students who were trying to learn it.

I taught the class, which takes about an hour and a half, eight times. In Spring Quarter of my Senior year I handed it over to Andrew Wray, who I'm confident will do a great job with it.

#### The teaching materials, written in LaTeX (of course!) include:

* A slideshow.
* A book-style document with a more detailed description of the topics.
* A worksheet that has an example of most of the topics in the class. I ask students to try to make their own document mimicking the worksheet.

The documents that students need are [here](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B5P_UFIGCcUaMDc2OTI2NTktMGU5Mi00OGNkLWIwODItMTVhMzZhM2RjNGU1/edit?num=50&sort=name&layout=list#). The source code for everything is [on GitHub](https://github.com/bgschiller/latex-course).

The university newspaper wrote a [small article about the class](http://www.westernfrontonline.net/news/article_512400df-0419-5171-9c79-ab3efe785ac6.html).
