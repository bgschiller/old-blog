One day, my friend Matt Eshbach asked me, "So you can be 1/2 wizard, or 1/4 wizard. But can you be any proportion? What about 1/3?" The question turns out to have a really elegant answer, but let's work our way up to it. (Note: In order to simplify the math, we will not consider squibs or muggle-born wizards as part of the analysis. I hope those readers will not feel too marginalized by this decision).
