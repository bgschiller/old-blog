My personal webpage is published using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) on Github pages, and the layout is based on the [Minimal Mistakes](http://mademistakes.com/) theme.
It can be viewed at brianschiller.com

Some differences from the Minimal Mistakes theme:

* There are separate categories for portfolio work and blog posts, but they are still listed in chronological order in 'All Posts'
* (soon) Summary pages will display a thumbnail photo alongside the description if one is provided.
